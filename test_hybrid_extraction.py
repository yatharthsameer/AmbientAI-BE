Sarah: Good morning, Mrs. Rodriguez! It's Sarah from HomeCare Health. How're you feeling today?
Mrs. Rodriguez: Hello, Sarah. Come in. I'm sore, but better than yesterday. This hip's still a bother.
Sarah: I bet. Let's get you to your chair. Mind if I wash my hands first? (Washes hands at sink.) Alright, today we'll check your vitals, review meds, and maybe try some exercises. Sound okay?
Mrs. Rodriguez: Fine by me. Want some tea? I made a pot.
Sarah: Sweet of you, but I'll pass‚Äîlet's focus on you. Pain level, 1 to 10?
Mrs. Rodriguez: About a 5. Hurts more when I walk.
(Sarah notes this.)
Sarah: Let's start with blood pressure and temperature. Sleeve up, please? (Takes BP: 128/82, temp: 98.6¬∞F.) BP's a bit high, but not bad post-surgery. Blood sugar this morning?
Mrs. Rodriguez: 140 before breakfast. Took my insulin like you showed me.
Sarah: Nice work! Let's check it now. (Does glucometer test: 135 mg/dL.) Steady‚Äîgood job with your diet. Any dizziness or falls?
Mrs. Rodriguez: No falls, thank God. But I'm tired a lot. And lonely‚Äîmy daughter's far away.
Sarah: Recovery can feel isolating. We'll talk more about that. Let's see your incision. Lift your gown? (Inspects hip.) Looks good‚Äîno redness. Keep using that antibiotic cream twice a day, okay?
Mrs. Rodriguez: Will do. You're gentle, Sarah.
(Sarah documents, washes hands.)
Sarah: Let's go over meds. Show me your pill organizer? (Mrs. Rodriguez hands it over.) Oxycodone every 6 hours as needed? How many yesterday?
Mrs. Rodriguez: Two in the morning, one at night. Helps, but I'm constipated.
Sarah: Common side effect. Try prunes or oatmeal, and lots of water. Diabetes meds: Metformin twice a day, insulin at meals. Any low blood sugar?
Mrs. Rodriguez: Once last week‚Äîfelt shaky, ate candy like you said.
Sarah: Smart! Remember 15 grams of carbs, wait 15 minutes, recheck. Here's a handout. (Gives sheet.) Change your dressing daily, call if it's warm or oozing. Questions?
Mrs. Rodriguez: The exercises‚Äîthe leg lifts hurt.
Sarah: Let's ease into those. Show me how you do them? (Guides Mrs. Rodriguez through demo.) Perfect‚Äî10 reps, three times a day.
(Pause for practice.)
Sarah: Feeling okay? Let's try walking to the kitchen with your walker. (They walk slowly.) Nice posture‚Äîkeep that up.
